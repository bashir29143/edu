Unusual ways to keep fit.\\

Good morning everybody.


I guess everyone know about different ways to keep fit as fitness and running.
Today I am going to tell you about some unusual ways to keep fit: ice skating, rock climbing and dancing.


I will be happy to answer your questions at the end of my talk.


Firstly, let’s take a look at ice skating.
With skating, you’ll be working small, stabilizing muscle groups without even knowing it. And once you get going, it’s easy to get addicted. Skating for an hour can burn anywhere from 345 to 900 calories!


Let’s turn now to rock climbing.
Like swimming and biking, Rock Climbing is also categorized as a cardiovascular activity, and a great way to get your heart pumping and blood flowing.


And finally, let’s look at dancing.
Dancing uses muscles all over your body.
So you can burn calories while having a good time.


Let me make some conclusion. If you don’t want to join a gym, it is a lot of ways to be in a good shape.


Thanks for your attention.
Are there any questions?
